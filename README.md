# Node RESTFUL API
Full API With Node Js and React Front End by default.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm dev`

Runs the app for development to the `src` folder.<br />
it reloads when any file in the `src` folder is edited.
<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

### `npm run start`
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles covid-js in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes with source maps.<br />

### `npm run prestart`

Launches the test build runner in the watch mode.<br />

### `npm run lint`

Check for errors and warning in thre `src` folder

### `npm run test`

Does nothing at the moment.<br />


### `npm run frontend`
Move into the `frontend` directory and start the react app
<br />

### `npm run fullstack`

Uses concurrently to run both the development server and the react frontend and watch the `/src` and `/frontend/src` for changes respectively. <br/>
